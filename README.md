Developed with Unreal Engine 4

The project iss a relatively simple puzzle game, split into three sections. In the first section, the player is put in a tiled office, with a door asking for a certain code to get through it. To go through the door, the user must mark on the code which corresponding tiles in the room are occupied by objects. The next section of the game is a long hall, filled with pedestals and hints. The user must use the hints in the room to guess the names of objects on a terminal. Once the user has guessed the name of every object, they can then proceed to the final section. The last section is a small room filled with clocks and mirrors. To leave the section, the player must input a time into a code-reader on the last door. This timecode is found in one of the "mirrors" in the room. This "mirror" does not reflect normally, and instead gives the user a view into a completely different room, with a clock stuck on a time in it.
